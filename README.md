# Duckling

English | [中文](./README.zh.md)

Duckling is a lightweight desktop application built using Tauri, designed for quickly browsing `parquet`/`csv` file data and various databases.
It supports [DuckDB](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb)

Note: The current objective of this project is not to develop a fully functional database management tool, but rather to facilitate quick browsing of various types of data.

## Installation

From releases page to download the latest installation package, for
installation.

For Windows platform, you can download and [install Webview2 offline](<(https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/#download-section)>) if you
cannot install Webview2 due to network problems.

**Note**: When selecting a path for the software, choose an empty folder or opt to create a new folder. Do not put data files in the installation path. Avoid selecting a non-empty folder, as during uninstallation, if you choose to clear data files, the entire folder will be deleted, even if it does not belong to the software itself.

## Usage

Open the data folder or `*.duckdb` file.
